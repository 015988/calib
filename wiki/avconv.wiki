#summary A quick howto on video conversion using libav

= Install =

== Linux ==
Install libav packages from your preferred source.

== Windows == 
Download the proper version from: 
http://win32.libav.org/releases/

(probably the highest version number for 64 bits)

Extract the files to a "good" place (like program files) and put the usr/bin subdirectory on the path. It obeys the cygwin structure, but it also works directly. Make sure the bin directory is on the path.


= Conversion =

This is a command line tool. It is very, very simple, but does not have the usual frills from visual applications.

First, open a command line prompt and go to the directory containing the videos to be converted. Then:

avconv -i input.xxx -c:v mjpeg -an out.avi

Where
  * input.xxx = original video
  * -c:v mjpeg : use the codec mjpeg for video (avconv -codecs lists all available codecs)
  * -an : Remove audio stream
  * out.avi : output video
