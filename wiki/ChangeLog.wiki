== Release 46 10/04/2009==
Major changes:
* New method to estimate R and T when using chess calibration. A little more simple and (hopefully) robust.
* Modifications in the error functions of the optimizations. Added a factor in the distortions to reduce the impact of small variations. (k1 usually is between 1 and -1, T is usually bigger than 100, we had to "normalize" the search space.

== Release 44 30/03/2009==
Added a new algorithm to estimate extrinsic parameters when using a new, 9 points only, calibration pattern.

== Release 42 27/03/2009==
Distortion coefficients removed from the optimization step when using intrinsic parameters computed with J. Bouguet's toolbox. 

== Release 40 21/03/2009==
Some issues related to r27 fixed. (The non linear opt. now only considers extrinsic parameters when using the intrinsic parameters computed with J. Bouguet's toolbox).

== Release 27 15/11/2008==
Added support for importing the intrinsic parameters computed with J. Bouguet's toolbox.
(since r17, with some minor bug corrections. Use r27)
